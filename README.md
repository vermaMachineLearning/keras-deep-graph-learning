# Welcome to Keras Deep Learning on Graphs (Keras-DGL)

The aim of this keras extension is to provide Sequential and Functional API for performing deep learning tasks on graphs. Specifically, Keras-DGL provides implementation for these particular type of layers, 

* Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphCNN).
* Graph Attention Convolutional Neural Networks (GraphAttentionCNN). 
* Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GraphConvLSTM). 
* Graph Capsule Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GraphCapsuleCNN) TBD. 
* Graph Message Passing Neural Networks (GraphNeuralNetworks) TBD. 
* Keras-DGL also contains implementation of various graph convolutional filters TBD.
